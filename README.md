# Supply chain simulation

just building a system to understand supply chain in detail. a better way to do this was to think of a problem within my range (for example: campus equipment inventory to solve the reservation disruptancies). the goal is to also build a few exception handling..

an ER diagram to get started. I'll put more details into it later.
